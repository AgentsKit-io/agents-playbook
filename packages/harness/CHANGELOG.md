## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Strict TypeScript modular core with generated declarations and source maps.
- Contract-frozen lifecycle, structured evidence, stale detection, human approval, retry, and cleanup.
- Explicit human cancellation and superseded retry history.
- Typed dependency-aware plugin lifecycle with deterministic cleanup.
- Append-only, source- and contract-bound lifecycle event log per run.
- Declarative profile inheritance with validated check overrides.
- Optional provenance-bearing context provider slot for Doc Bridge and Playbook adapters.
- Dependency-free Doc Bridge index adapter with deterministic references and frozen context snapshots.
- Context lifecycle events and stable context hashes that ignore resolution timestamps.
- Portable CLI snapshot resolution and `plan --context-file` binding for shell-based agents.
- Tamper-evident validation for imported context snapshots.
- Direct API callers now receive the same tamper-evident context validation as CLI callers.
- `benchmarkRuns` and `ak-harness benchmark` for reproducible historical run metrics.
- Phase 0 benchmark manifests, task identity bindings, and explicit baseline comparisons.
- Typed agent session recorder with correlated turn/tool events and guarded ordering.
- Adapter metadata and session event protocol that persists hashes instead of raw agent content.
- Required deny-by-default Policy Gate with ordered rules and correlated blocked-tool events.
- Bounded in-process tool runtime with timeout, abort signal, hashed results, and structured failures.
- Shell-free child-process runtime with timeout, output limits, and structured process failures.
- Optional Docker runtime with a no-network, read-only, unprivileged, resource-limited sandbox profile.
- Typed runtime attestation with Docker image digest and effective profile hash in terminal tool events.
- Controlled baseline observation recording through the typed API and `ak-harness benchmark baseline`, with duplicate, unknown-task, and atomic-write protections.
- Benchmark comparisons now require completed harness evidence and report honest non-comparability reasons plus check, outcome, evidence, and review metrics.
- `ak-harness` CLI and `ak-verify` common-protocol alias.
- Public package documentation and community policy files.
